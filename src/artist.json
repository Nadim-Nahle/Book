        "cover": "Finally, when Yusef finished, he brought to the Basha a small pottery vessel sealed with lead and dark wax, red colored and saturated with blue. He requested the Basha that a virgin girl bury that pot under a slab in the middle of the palace at a depth of two meters.  \n\nThe women of the palace were enthusiastic about everything Yusef was doing. Farlan, Assia, and Bahri had magical powers, which they concealed very discreetly from the Basha. Nasli did not miss any of Yusef's movements, not out of curiosity about what he was doing, but for another reason:  that thing that you cannot deny, you feel it, though you cannot identify, or explain it.  \n\nYes, that thing happened, the hidden river ran between them, that water that Youssef always wished to avoid it forever, he wanted to escape from her at the exact moment his eyes met hers. Yusef predicted the abilities of the three women of the palace, as he paid attention to one of those hieroglyphs carved with precision over the door of Sitt Neslihan’s room. ",

Lina is the\ndaughter of this desert, of its myths and its incredible stories, the same ones that have fascinated\norientalists. In addition, she opened the intimate rooms of the palaces and houses of the city of\nDamascus, Aleppo and Antioch to tell us stories about the different populations and religions that\ncoexisted in the Middle East: Middle Eastern Jews in the early 20th century, the tragedy of the\nArmenians, the migration of the Circassians, and the arrival of those fleeing the Bolshevik Revolution\nto the city of Aleppo, as well as the Kurds in northern Syria.\n\nThe hybridity of her subjects finds its primary source in her extraordinary nomadic life, since her\nchildhood. Lina was born into a family belonging to a desert tribal community in the desert of the\nLevant, and at the same time she lived and moved with her family in different cities and places\nbecause of her father's work as an army officer.\nShe was born in an old Aleppo mansion that was turned into rented rooms in the seventies, in which\nMuslims, Christians and Jews live side by side. Then she lived in the city of Latakia, on the seashore,\nwhere there is a multi-sectarian city. At the same time, she maintained her close relationship with\nthe Syrian desert and her relatives who live a nomadic life. She lived for two years in the desert with\nher grandmother and travelled with her. They lived in a tent woven from goat hair and a flock of\nsheep.\nShe moved after into a house in the middle of a fish farm that used to belong to the army. And she\nlived among water snakes and turtles, and carried with her different memories as she moved to the\ncity of Damascus and lived her adolescence there, studying philosophy and working in cultural\njournalism. In 2011, she moved to Beirut because of the Syrian war and devoted herself entirely to\nwriting. She became one of the most important Arab writers, and her works were very popular.\n\nThe works of the novelist Lina Houyan Al-Hassan dealt with the worlds of the deserts of the Middle\nEast, and she is the first to write about it in the novel Sultans of Sand (2009, a biography of the most\nfamous beauties of the Levant, between 1880 and 1950), Men and Tribes (2015, a documentary\nabout the tribal history of the Syrian desert).\nAfter that, her works followed on the Damascene society, and dealt with the secrets of Damascene\nwomen, such as the novel A whole Betrayal (2022, the story of the last Damascene harem and the\nbiography of the first woman who drove a car in Syria), and Nazik Khanum (2020, the story of a\nDamascene model who lived in Paris in (the seventies). She wrote Antioch and the Kings of the\nShadow, a novel about the city of Aleppo before Antioch was annexed to Turkey (2021, the story of\na group of women who underwent through major transformations that witnessed the transition\nfrom feudalism to the beginnings of the Modern State, and its impact on their ideas and lives).

        "details":" ”Neslihan” is the daughter of “Ferlan&quot;, who was kidnapped from a Portuguese\ncolony on one of the shores of India to Salman. She was raised by the Sabian\nchamberlain, and later participated in the 1927 demonstration in Marjah Square\nto demand the right to unveil. A &quot;woman&quot; who is a figment of the imagination,\nand any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental with stories that fly in all\ndirections to be disguised as dozens of new bodies.\n\n3\n\n&quot;We see a group of our daughters, some of them are French, some are English,\nand some are American, Russian, or Prussian. Therefore, the principles of the\ndaughters, who belong to the same homeland, have varied, as well as their\nupbringings, or rather their beliefs and traditions, have somewhat diverged.&quot;\nMary Ajami , Al Arous Magazine, January 1912\n\nShe’s Going to Be Sinister a Bit\n\nEveryone still remembers the moon at the moment of her birth. On that night,\nit was glowing like a wild restive beast on the thirteenth of August 1901 A.D. The\nfull moon was the brightest in light and the largest in size in one of the rare lunar\nphenomena along the vast desert surrounding Damascus. It was shining, agitating\nthe manes of the galloping horses, and the wind was a madman that uprooted the\ncalmness from the humans’ hearts, threatening the tranquility of a wide sky, as if\neverything on earth was trying to cope with the super capabilities of the moon\nwith Its frightening brightness and exceptional beauty flowing above canyons,\nrocks, and seeping among the clouds, as if she was born from the wreckage of its\nlight on the ground. For a moment, this light descended among the mortals, as if\nit wanted to be felt, intimate, and residing in the shroud of the savagery, to be\naroused on that night within the women’s wailing voices, all mixed in a single\nmourner: “the precious and honorable Turkan Khanum has passed away!”\nAs soon as Nasli was born, her grandmother died, and her mother’s rival was\nburied by the shroud of that moonlight.\n\n4\n\nIt’s a lunar phenomenon that the pessimists call “the curse of the gutter” in\nwhich earthquakes and floods occur, seas are agitated, and ships run aground, as\nif the whole Earth was crammed into something outside the context of time and\nspace.\nThat night, the sky smothered, grimaced, raged with thunder and lightning, and\nthen it rained. The newborn child had cried her first cries. Finally, the morning\nstar crept amidst the murmur of the wind which began to subside. The sky\nsilenced and the storm subsided; the great Khanum Turkan died, the grandmother\nwhom Neslihan was destined not to see, but she wore all her clothes, gloves,\nshoes, and her royal Nilofer dress.\nNeslihan, Al-Basha’s only daughter, was brought up among three women:\n&quot;Assia&quot; ,the Sabian woman and the chamberlain of the palace, &quot;Bahri&quot;, the black\nmaid, and her mother, &quot;Ferlan&quot;, the charming Indian Khanum. &quot;Assia&quot; used to\nsay: &quot;Every person has his horoscope and his fate above his forehead. Wherever\nwe roamed, the sky itself with its stars, planets, galaxies, and meteorites... She\nwould read the sky as if she were reading a book whose words were clear.\n\nThe &quot;Beloved Assia&quot; believed in the influences of astronomy, while Nasli's\nmother, &quot;Ferlan Khanum,&quot; believed in the capabilities of magic that she had\ninherited from her family in India, before being snatched by the nuns in that small\nmonastery on the seashore where a small Portuguese colony was accompanied by\na spirited and diligent missionary.\n&quot;Assia&quot;, the old fortune teller of the palace, looked at the child's face, brought\nit close to the flickering light and looked up at the vault of heaven. She was face\nto face with the moon while its light flooded over the window.\n“She will be a bit evil,” Assia said, while the maid, &quot;Bahri&quot;, whispered, “a\nbeautiful child who will look like our honorable “Turkan Khanum&quot;.”\n\nFerlan Khnum did not live the moment of infatuation in front of the male child,\nrealizing that she would not be the lucky mother of a male child, so that she could\nproudly reveal his small male organ to her visitors. The chamberlain of the palace,\n\n5\n\n&quot;Assia,&quot; or as Nasli used to call her, or &quot;the Beloved,&quot; used to describe the gait of\nBasha’s daughter as tickling, and when Nasli asked her: “How?”, she used to say:\n“you don't walk at one pace; you are a girl who, sometimes, seems firm, and then\nsoon becomes relaxed.”\nShe was able to describe all the ways women can move; she had an unlimited\nexperience in women’s gaits. While Nanny &quot;Bahri&quot; confirmed to Nasli in what\nlooks like an advice: &quot;It is easy for a beautiful woman to attract attention, but she\nshould not be satisfied with that. She should raise doubts and questions, spread\nfear in the heart of the man she wants to keep for a long time.&quot;\nThe Beloved Assia was an intelligent lady, expert in all shapes and forms that\nwomen could look like, as she had spent thirty years of her life tasked with\nselecting concubines for the Basha.\nIn her choices, she focused on the erased shoulders, the plumpy chest\noverlooking a shrunken belly, and she paid a great attention to the upper body\nthat is inclined to the back, which indicates an aristocratic origin.\nWith her eyes, she could measure the width of the shoulders, the deviation of\nthe ribs, and the slenderness of the waist. The hand should be precise at the\nwrist, and at the arms should be full upward.\n\nShe hated reckless women; she would expose any woman by the way she\ntouched things. For her, the smart woman is the one who, slowly and elegantly,\ntouches everything around her. She has to sense what she holds between her\nhands like when she eats, drinks her cup of coffee, or puts on her clothes. She\nhated hasty women even if they were beautiful in appearance, and throughout\nher service in the Basha's Harem, she did not allow any of them to enter it.\nNone of the woman's body part would be exempted from examination. The\narmpits, the ears, the opening of the vulva, and even the buttocks cavity were all\nexamined. She used to supervise their food, which should be void of spices, garlic,\nand onions. Only salt is allowed to ensure their fragrant breaths. Never did she\nmiss to focus on the curves of the pelvis, the curvature of the back, and the\ntwisting of the ribs.\n\n6\n\nThe &quot;Beloved Assia&quot; did not show any difficulty in describing the subtle features\nof beauty, finding an interesting analogy for all the features of the body parts, but\nshe showed more emphasis on some features.\nFor instance, the face comes first, and it has rules. The waist reveals and\nestablishes the upper beauty, which indicates the way of walking and moving.\n“We have to maintain the weight of our bodies”, that is, to be slim, but some\nparts should be plumpy. As for the hip and buttocks, here is the part that the\nBeloved focuses on while examining the bends of the pelvis. This indicates a\nwoman’s fertility and her ability to be pregnant even at an elder age.\n\nAssia had always believed that our fates are affected by the motions of the\nspheres. Every night she could read one of those signs deposited in the sky. The\nplace in which a star shines affects a human who was born at that moment from\nhis mother's womb. She paid a great attention to that imaginary relationship\nbetween the body, the planets, and the constellations because of her great fear\nof the hidden powers that can harm the body, or the invisible evil hidden forces.\nThe day Farlan arrived to the Harem, Assia declared the beauty of the newcomer:\n&quot;The eye cannot but stop at the beauty of her neck&quot;, Assia declared that her neck\nand shoulders were wonderful."

        "details":"Born in Lebanon in 1970, David Daoud lives and works in the Vexin, and exhibits notably between\nParis, Belgium and Lebanon.\nDavid began drawing and painting at a very young age. Based in Paris, he continued his studies at the\nEcole Supérieure Nationale des Arts Décoratifs de Paris. He perfected his technique with his mentor,\nthe famous sculptor Charles Auffret, himself a disciple of Auguste Rodin.\n\nAn artist, painter, designer, sculptor, hard worker, David Daoud, draws his inspiration from nature\nand Cave Art. He is inhabited by a “Dream of the absolute”, one of those artists who does not inhabit\nthe present, of these dreamers who escape the violence and chaos of the world by taking refuge in\ntheir imaginary universe.\nIn music, poetry, nature too... An old-fashioned artist – in the positive sense of the term – who\ndraws his inspiration from the sources of cave art, the great masters of painting, pieces from the\nrepertoire German Romanticism, Handel's oratorios, Baudelairian poems and even the\ncontemplation of nature.\nHere, a reference to ancient frescoes, there, graphic figures evocative of primitive scenes, further,\nsets of characters drawn with a brush removed in the style of Rembrandt. A mixture of inspirations\nand influences which gives his paintings a timeless aesthetic, between contemporary touches and\nclassic breath.\nIn the symbolist vein, flirting with impressionism, the painter expresses himself mainly in large\nformat. His favourite themes relate to the passing of time: exile, travel, distance, nostalgia, absence\nand eternity.\nThe artist has exhibited in numerous galleries, museums and cultural sites in France, Belgium and\nLebanon.\nHis works are present in the permanent collection of the Institut du Monde Arabe (Paris) and\nPrehistorique Museum of Beyrouth (Liban).\nIn 2018, Ibrahim Maalouf chose one of his works for the cover of his album ‘Levantine Symphony’.\n\nPermanent Artist at :\nChristine Colon Gallery- Liège - (Belgique)\nDanielle Bourdette Gallery - Honfleur\nL’Amour de l'Art Gallery - rue de Seine - Paris\nMatthieu Dubuc Gallery - Rueil Malmaison\nCheriff Tabet Gallery - Beyrouth - Liban\nMurmure Gallery - Colmar – France\nSeptentrion Gallery - Marcq en Baroeil (59) – France\n\nMuseum - Permanent Collection\nInstitut du Monde Arabe - Paris (France)\nBeirut Prehistoric Museum.
